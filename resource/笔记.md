# 关键系统调用

关键是使用`ptrace()`系统调用。

```C
long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid,
            void *addr, void *data);
```

`request` is what we would like to do to the traced process; `pid` is the process ID of the traced process; `addr` is a memory address, which is used in some calls to designate an address in the tracee; and `data` is some request-specific resource.
